        <div class="workExp">
            I have worked many jobs for only being 18. I have worked at KFC and Tacobell, where I was a cashier and also worked in the kitchen at times, mostly manning the fryer or putting together the meals. I have also worked at McDonalds and the Salvation Army, both through the summer or 2022, and left both of those jobs at the end of summer. In November of 2022, I started at MacQuarries Pharmacy as a Pharmacy cashier, and then got promoted this year to a Pharmacy Assistant, in where I package prescriptions for patients and give them to the Pharmacist to confirm and send them out.
